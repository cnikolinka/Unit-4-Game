2. have a random number generator between 19-120
3. have four crystals each generating a random number (thats hidden)
4. when player clicks on the crystal it shows the number 
5. each time a crystal is clicked it uses that number and adds up
6. if the player matches the comuputers number with the sum of their crystal numbers they get a win
7. if they go over they get a lose
